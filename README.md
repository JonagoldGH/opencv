# OpenCV Study
Hello! Welcome to my GitHub repository for my studies in OpenCV.
Here I will post all code from my projects and you guys can try it out!

**Background**
I started coding about 2 months ago in the Python language, and used OpenCV as well as other packages inside the software.
I use the Anaconda's Spyder platform to write my code, and run it in Python version 3.8. 

**Code**
You may use my open-source code entirely without crediting.
Everything I write will have annotations explaining what they do, so be sure to read them and understand more of what the functions mean.
I will try to update the repository every day as soon as I finish coding.

**Mission**
I started this GitHub repository for everyone to be able to see and use my code.
I believe that anyone is able to code, and it is a really interesting hobby/career to pursue.
If you guys have code that you want to share with me, you can commit changes in the public branch.

**Links**
Anaconda is the platform that I use to code, and can be found on https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual.
My code is entirely written in Python, and its documentation can be found on https://www.python.org/.
You will need to download the OpenCV package, which can be found here: https://opencv.org/.

Good luck, and have fun!
